# Flask-SQLAlchemy Relationships Lab

## Overview

This Flask app models an event management system with multiple relationships between models using SQLAlchemy. It demonstrates:

- One-to-Many: Event âž¡ Sessions
- One-to-One: Speaker âž¡ Bio
- Many-to-Many: Session â†” Speaker

Youâ€™ll find a fully working backend with proper migrations, seeded data, relationship querying, and tested RESTful endpoints.

## Entity Relationships

### ðŸ“Š Modeled ERD Relationships

- An `Event` **has many** `Sessions`
- A `Session` **belongs to one** `Event`
- A `Speaker` **has one** `Bio`
- A `Bio` **belongs to one** `Speaker`
- A `Session` **has many** `Speakers` through `session_speakers`
- A `Speaker` **has many** `Sessions` through `session_speakers`
